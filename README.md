# Capstone-Project

This repository contains the code required to build a ML-model in PySpark to predict the users who will churn, using Sparkify data. It also contains a blog, in a pdf format, describing this process in detail.

**Installation**

This code has a number of required dependencies which have to be pre-installed to work. They include:

- SparkSession
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- The dataset is provided by udacity - "mini_sparkify_event_data.json"

**Motivation** 

The motivation behind this project was to showcase the ability of PySpark to provide business value to a company. Specifically, we wanted to use Spark Machine Learning library to predict which of Sparkify's users will churn. PySpark is very suitable for this due to it's cluster computing, meaning it can process a large amount of data without creating a bottleneck. For the purpose of this project though, the local mode was utilised however this can easily be scaled onto cloud platforms such as AWS.
